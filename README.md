### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Viola Negroni, I'm from Italy and I am currently pursuing a Master Degree in Music and Acoustic Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan.

A creative soul with the mindset of an engineer, I always strived to find a way that could enable these facets of my personality to work together in harmony, until I realized that music was the key.
I strongly believe in music as a universal language that speaks to our cores and fuels our lives, and that it is in music that today art and technology can jointly flourish at their best.

I'm particularly interested - and eager to deepen my knowledge - in audio processing and deep learning techniques devoted to Music Information Retrieval (MIR), with a focus on emotion analysis (Music Emotion Recognition), but I am interested as well in Music Classification and Recommendation.

I define myself as an "advanced beginner" and a fast learner: curiosity and flexibility brought me into building a quite heterogeneous educational background, determination and precision allowed me to effectively succeed in that. Challenges excite me, I never take the easy way.

Let's keep in touch: you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngrvli/), or you can download [here](violangg/Negroni_engCV.pdf) my resume and drop me an email!
